# hello-world

What's up yall!? (as if this is actually gonna be read by somebody)

Diving a bit deeper into the world of 3D printing, so I finally decided to give
GitHub a try as far as understanding it a bit more. Have been an user for a while now
but never really understood what was in front of me when downloading some of the files :)

I'll see you around!
